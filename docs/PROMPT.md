The original prompt used in [Google AI Studio](https://ai.dev/) to begin this application is available below:

```md
I want you to build me "Jarvis" using the Gemini Live API. It should enable you to have a conversation with Jarvis where Jarvis can perform the following actions:

- Jarvis can talk with you
- Search: Jarvis supports grounding with Google Search using the Gemini API
- Create: Jarvis can create an illustration for you using Nano Banana Pro
Reimagine: Jarvis can take a photo of you and revision it using Nano Bana Pro

```

You can refine the application with follow-up prompts to make the experience better. For example:

- Make sure to log actions you are taking in the UI
- Make sure the the permissions flow for camera and microphone is clear to the user
